# Switch to Java

## Lesson 1 - Java Building Blocks

### Before you start

You need to install on your machine:
* JDK 8 from: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
* Git https://git-scm.com/download/win
* Java IDE: download Intellij https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows

Things to know:
* JRE: Java Runtime Environment is an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine where your Java programs run on
* JDK: Besides of the JRE it contains also the Java Development Kit needed for developing java applications (java, javac ...)
* Java SE: Java Standard Edition contains all Java libraries used in any Java program (java.lang, java.util, java.math, java.io, java.net ...)
* Java EE: Java Enterprise Edition Java EE includes many components of the Java Standard Edition (Java SE).The Java EE platform consists of a set of services, APIs, and protocols that provide the functionality for developing multitiered, Web-based applications.

### Things we discuss:
* Why Java ? OOP, Platform independent, Robust, Simple, Secure and Data protection
* Classes - template used to model state and behavior of things
* Objects - intances of classes created by using the "new" keyword
* State - defined by the object's properties
* Behavior - defined by the object's methods. They implement an algorithm and manipulate data
* Instance Initializer
* Identifiers and keywords - name of classes, objects, methods and keywords specific to the language
* Inheritance - concept used to reuse code
* Interfaces - define behavor of a class
* Java naming convention for classes, interfaces, methods, fields and constants
* Primitive types (byte, char, short, int, long, float, double, boolean)
* Variables: local, static or instance variables
* Garbage Collector
* Operators - unary, binary, ternary
* Numeric promotion
* Statements (if-then-else, switch, while, for, for each
* String class. Available methods. Why is it so special?
* StringBuilder. What are the available methods? Homework: Read about StringBuffer. Is it different?
* Arrays, ArrayList (<> diamond operator)
* Wrapper classes
* Autoboxing
* java.time API
* Methods. Overloading rules
* Constructor. Initialization rules
* Data encapsulation
* What is an immutable class?
* What is lambda?
* Class design. Inheritance and constructor definition rules
* Override rules. Homework: can you override static methods?
* Abstract class
* Interfaces methods and fields
* Polimorphism - references, casting
* Exeptions
